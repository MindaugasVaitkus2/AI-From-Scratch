# Introduction 

We are a species who are highly intelligent capable of turning events. We can make war, we can make coffee and start a revolution. Time in its very essence has revealed invaluable secrets to human beings about its nature which has allowed us to evolve and hence made us greater than any other speies around us. The capabilities of human beings are just expanding, from creating a wheel to spliting the atom, we seen everything that makes up a species like us. And now we are aiming to the stars. 

Our intelligence is expanding in an incredible rate. The thought of what we can do relies in the deepest part of our brain. At one point we are aimless, with no purpose in our lives -- we feel contempt about ourselves, we feel invaluable -- but other times we are as strong like never before. Our intelligence is completely different from what we feel, the ground truth is we have a system build inside of us that has invaluable information stored within itself. It is only a matter of chosing. Once we choose to rely on the truth, we can unravel all the mysteries of the universe. 

<b>Being intelligent is all about ataining skills and knowledge to make decision and comprehend the world in all it's beauty. </b>

Our brain is one of the most important parts in our body. But, why it is important? I believe because it can think and make decisions. 

The brain is one of the most complex organ in a human system. It carefully observes all the information and stores it inside of it. Memories aren’t stored in just one part of the brain. Different types are stored across different, interconnected brain regions. For explicit memories – which are about events that happened to you (episodic), as well as general facts and information (semantic) – there are three important areas of the brain: the hippocampus, the neocortex and the amygdala. Implicit memories, such as motor memories, rely on the basal ganglia and cerebellum. Short-term working memory relies most heavily on the prefrontal cortex.

The role of a brain in a human system is not limited to observing and storing information but far more than that. It controls the whole human system. Right from the eyes to the ears, our heart, our lungs, each and every part is controlled by the brain. Its main function is to survive and meaning to the life. Besides talking about the subconscious, the brain has played in the major part for the survival of the Human race.
