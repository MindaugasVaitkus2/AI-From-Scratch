# Linear Algebra

Mathematics is known as the language of the universe. It is because of maths that the universe behaves the way is does. We say that the universe is uncertain, its ways are uneven, but deep in its heart the universe knows what it is doing. Its ways are higher and thoughts are inscrutable. 

Most of them speculate that the universe has its favourite number and that is, 1.618... 

Mathematics as a whole is divided into the following categoricies: 

1.	Classification systems
2.	Major divisions of mathematics
- 2.1	Pure mathematics
  -	Foundations
  -	Number Theory
  -	Algebra
  -	Combinatorics
  -	Geometry and topology
  -	Analysis

 - 2.2	Applied mathematics
    - Probability and statistics
    - Computational sciences
    - Physical sciences
    - Other applied mathematics

Since our aim is to learn artificial intelligence we will only focusing on algebra and more precisely linear algebra.

Linear Algebra is a combination of two words **Linear** and **Algebra**. The latter mean something that is straight and the former means "restoration or completion". Meaning to take one side of the equation to another side of the equation. The idea of algebra came from the ancient babylonians. 

Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics, used widely throughout science and engineering. Yet because linear algebra is a form of continuous rather than discrete mathematics, hence it forms a good tool for physicist, mathematician and even engineers. A good understanding of linear algebra is essential for understanding and workingw ith many machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning algorithms. 

The following are the given important concepts and terms that we will be using throughtout this section. 


## Scalars, Vectors, Matrices and Tensors

## Multiplying Matrices and Vectors

## Identity and Inverse Matrices

## Linear Dependence and Span

## Norms

## Special Kinds of Matrices and Vectors

## Eigendecomposition

## Singular Value Decomposition

## The Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse

## The Trace Operator

## The Determinant

## Example: Principal Components Analysis
